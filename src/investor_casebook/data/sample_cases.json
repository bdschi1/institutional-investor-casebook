{"id": "PM-RISK-001", "category": "Portfolio Construction", "prompt": "A multi-strat portfolio is Long $500M US Tech (Beta 1.4), Long $300M 10Y Treasuries, and Short $400M S&P 500 Futures. The 10Y Yield spikes 50bps and the Nasdaq drops 3%. Decompose the primary risk drivers. Was the S&P short an effective hedge? What is the estimated P&L impact on the Tech sleeve vs. the Treasury sleeve?", "golden_answer": "Tech Sleeve: -$21M (1.4 Beta * -3% * $500M). Treasury Sleeve: -$10.5M (Approx. 7 duration * 0.50% * $300M). S&P Short: +$10.4M (Assuming 1.0 Beta, S&P dropped ~2.6% correlated to Nasdaq). Total P&L: -$21.1M. The S&P short was only a partial cross-hedge; it failed to offset the rate-driven duration loss and the higher-beta tech drawdown."}
