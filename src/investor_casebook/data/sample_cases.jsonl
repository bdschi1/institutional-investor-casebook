{"id": "PM-RISK-001", "category": "Portfolio Construction", "prompt": "A multi-strat portfolio is Long $500M US Tech (Beta 1.4), Long $300M 10Y Treasuries, and Short $400M S&P 500 Futures. The 10Y Yield spikes 50bps and the Nasdaq drops 3%. Decompose the primary risk drivers. Was the S&P short an effective hedge? What is the estimated P&L impact on the Tech sleeve vs. the Treasury sleeve?", "golden_answer": "Tech Sleeve: -$21M (1.4 Beta * -3% * $500M). Treasury Sleeve: -$10.5M (Approx. 7 duration * 0.50% * $300M). S&P Short: +$10.4M (Assuming 1.0 Beta, S&P dropped ~2.6% correlated to Nasdaq). Total P&L: -$21.1M. The S&P short was only a partial cross-hedge; it failed to offset the rate-driven duration loss and the higher-beta tech drawdown."}
{"id": "PM-RISK-002", "category": "Risk Decomposition", "prompt": "A healthcare-focused L/S equity fund returned +18% over the past 12 months. The healthcare sector index returned +22% over the same period. The fund's average net exposure was 40% and average gross exposure was 160%. The fund's beta to the healthcare sector index is 0.85. Decompose the fund's return into alpha and beta components. Did the PM generate positive stock-picking alpha, or was this purely environmental?", "golden_answer": "Beta contribution: 0.85 * 22% = +18.7%. Residual alpha: 18% - 18.7% = -0.7%. Despite strong absolute returns, the PM actually generated negative alpha of approximately -70bps. The entire return (and more) came from sector beta. At 40% net exposure, the fund should have captured roughly 0.40 * 22% = 8.8% from direction alone, suggesting the high gross exposure amplified both winners and losers. The PM underperformed a passive levered healthcare index. Conclusion: environmental return, not skill-based alpha."}
{"id": "PM-REG-001", "category": "Regulatory", "prompt": "Your senior analyst attended a biotech industry conference and had a private dinner with the CFO of a company in your portfolio. The CFO mentioned that the company will likely miss consensus revenue estimates by 15% next quarter due to a manufacturing delay that has not been publicly disclosed. The analyst has shared this information with you. What are the immediate steps you must take as PM? What are the regulatory implications?", "golden_answer": "Immediate action: (1) Place the stock on the restricted list immediately — no trading permitted. (2) Erect an information barrier (ethical wall) — isolate the analyst from all portfolio decisions on this name. (3) Notify Compliance within 24 hours with full details of the communication. (4) Document the timeline: when the information was received, who knows, and what actions were taken. Regulatory implications: This is MNPI (Material Non-Public Information) under SEC Rule 10b-5 and Regulation FD. Trading on this information would constitute insider trading. The 15% revenue miss is clearly material (exceeds the 5% materiality threshold). The manufacturing delay is non-public. The firm risks SEC enforcement action, disgorgement of profits, civil penalties up to 3x profits, and criminal prosecution. The analyst may have violated Regulation FD by receiving selective disclosure."}
{"id": "PM-SIZE-001", "category": "Position Sizing", "prompt": "You have high conviction in a biotech company with a Phase 3 catalyst in 60 days. Your estimate: 65% probability of approval (street consensus: 50%). On approval, the stock rallies +40%. On failure, it drops -60%. Current portfolio NAV is $2B and your max single-name risk limit is 5% of NAV. How would you size this position using both Kelly criterion and a risk-budget approach? Which method do you prefer and why?", "golden_answer": "Kelly criterion: Edge = (0.65 * 0.40) - (0.35 * 0.60) = 0.26 - 0.21 = 0.05. Kelly fraction = Edge / Odds = 0.05 / 0.40 = 12.5% of capital. Full Kelly = $250M notional (12.5% * $2B). Half-Kelly (standard practice) = $125M or 6.25% of NAV. Risk-budget approach: Max loss budget = 5% of NAV = $100M. Worst-case loss = -60%. Position size = $100M / 0.60 = $167M notional (8.35% of NAV). Both methods suggest $125M-$167M range. Preferred: Half-Kelly constrained by the risk-budget ceiling. Size at $125M (6.25% NAV) because (1) it respects the 5% risk limit at ~$75M max loss, (2) Kelly assumes edge certainty — in biotech binary events, a 15% edge vs consensus is aggressive, (3) Half-Kelly sacrifices only 25% of expected geometric growth rate while cutting variance in half."}
{"id": "PM-HEDGE-001", "category": "Hedge Effectiveness", "prompt": "During the March 2020 COVID crash, your fund held $200M in investment-grade corporate bonds hedged with $150M in CDX IG credit default swaps and $50M in S&P 500 put options (3-month, 10% OTM). IG spreads widened from 100bps to 370bps. The S&P dropped 34%. CDX IG widened from 50bps to 150bps. Evaluate the hedge effectiveness. Did the CDS and equity puts adequately protect the portfolio? What was the correlation breakdown?", "golden_answer": "Corporate bond loss: Duration ~6 years, spread widening 270bps. Estimated loss: 6 * 2.70% * $200M = -$32.4M. CDX IG hedge gain: Spread widened 100bps on $150M notional. At ~$50 DV01 per $1M notional: 100 * 50 * 150 = +$7.5M (or approximately $150M * 6 * 1.0% = +$9M using duration approximation). S&P put gain: 10% OTM puts on $50M notional, S&P dropped 34%. Intrinsic value at expiry: ~24% * $50M = +$12M (before premium, net gain ~$10M). Total hedge P&L: approximately +$17M to +$19M vs. -$32.4M bond loss. Net loss: -$13M to -$15M. Hedge covered only ~55% of losses. Correlation breakdown: IG bonds lost more than CDX implied because cash-CDS basis widened dramatically in the liquidity crisis. CDX tracks index spread mechanically, but cash bonds suffered additional mark-to-market from illiquidity premium and forced selling. The equity puts outperformed expectations due to vol spike (VIX from 15 to 82). Key lesson: CDS hedges underperform in liquidity crises because the cash-synthetic basis blows out."}
